     * OOP : Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism

     * Encapsulation: Data hiding
     *  make the field private
     *  provide access - using getters and setters
     *  Benefit:
     *      security purpose
     *      we can control what we put inside the field
     *      easier to maintain (it helps us to avoid some errors in the code
     *
     *      example :
     *          we have object where one of the fields can be only negative int value
     *          we directly assign the value to the that field
